        <h1>CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
        <p><h3>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics,<br>
             and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, <br>
            and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs,<br>
             run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.</h3></p>
        <p><h2>Types of cloud computing</h2>
            <h3>Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone.<br>
                 Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.<br>
                First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. <br>
                There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud.</h3></p>
