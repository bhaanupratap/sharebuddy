        <h1>COMPUTER NETWORKS</h1>
        <p><h3>A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. 
            <br> computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. 
            <br>These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, 
            <br>and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.</p>

            <p><h3>The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialised or general-purpose 
                <br>hosts. They are identified by network addresses, and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment.
                <br> Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.
            
                <br>Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, 
                <br>the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanism, and organizational intent.
            
                <br>Computer networks support many applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers,
                <br> and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.</h3></p>
