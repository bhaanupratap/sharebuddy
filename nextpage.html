        <h1>Communication Protocolo</h1>
        <p><h3>A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows 
        <br>two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via
        <br> any kind of variation of a physical quantity. 
        <br>The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization 
        <br>of communication and possible error recovery methods.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>Communication protocols assist varied network devices to converse with each other by
            <br> transmitting the analog signals, digital signals, different files & process the 
            <br>data from one device to other devices. These types of protocols are applicable 
            <br>in telecommunication & computer networks where suitable rules are executed 
            <br>to transmit information from source to destination. The most vital protocols
             <br>within networking are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) & User datagram protocol (UDP).</h3></p>
